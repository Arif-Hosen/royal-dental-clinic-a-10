            <p className=' p-5'>The Royal Dental Clinic exists to power the profession of dentistry and to assist our members in advancing the overall oral health of their patients. Together with our 162,000 members, we’ve been driving dentistry forward for 100 years.

                We are strong advocates for our members – promoting the art and science of dentistry by supporting dental professionals through services like Find-a-Dentist, credentialing tools, contract review and much more. Our mission is to ensure all member dentists have what they need, when they need it and even before it is needed to succeed.

                We are also strong advocates for public health – fighting oral cancer and combating the opioids crisis – and we’re teaming up with industry partners to help you stay healthy from the dental chair to daily care at home.

                We will continue working toward our vision – working side by side with our member dentists – to achieve optimal health for all.</p>
